the space-time warping simulator is a python program that aims to demonstrate the concept of space and time curvature as predicted by einstein's general theory of relativity. this tool simplifies the intricate physics into a visual representation, allowing users to explore the bending of space and time caused by gravitational effects.

how to use:
1. run python3 space_time_warp.py.
2. input parameters: users can input specific parameters related to gravity and height to observe the effects on space and time.
3. visualization: the tool utilizes visualization libraries to demonstrate the curvature of space and time. it may display plots or animations to convey the bending caused by gravity.

simulation parameters:
- gravity strength: users can adjust the strength of gravity to observe its impact on space and time.
- heights: various heights can be inputted to simulate the effects at different distances from the gravitational source.

visualization output:
the program will generate visual output showcasing the curvature of space and time based on the provided parameters. this could be presented through plots, graphs, or animations, offering an intuitive representation of the complex physics involved.

example output:
visual representation of space-time curvature based on user-defined gravity strength and heights.

tool classification:
this tool serves as a space-time warping simulator, aiming to provide users with a simplified yet illustrative understanding of how gravity can bend space and time, aligning with the principles of einstein's general theory of relativity.
